## Requirements
- A pc from 2065
- Unity (the decompile was made on 2019.4.29f1, but any version above or within the range should work)
## Known Issues
- Currently multiplayer doesn't work. I have no idea why but I don't feel like fixing it as of now
- Physics and lighting feel slightly different. Very likely because of unity version difference
## Credits
All credits go to reallyhandsomepeople (and Nintendo too, obviously) for this absolutely fantastic game. [Go show them some love.](https://www.youtube.com/user/reallyhandsomepeople)
